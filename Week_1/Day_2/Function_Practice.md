# Best Function Practice
We learn about what is the best practice of writing a [function](https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html#h_eVDWIAuyBK)

If you can, write a pure function = it only does one thing and one thing only

And it is better if the function end goal is to return a value, and not just to print to console

Return value = you can work with the return value

Print = hard coded, less adeptative
