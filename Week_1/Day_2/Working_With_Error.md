# What to do when error 
## Learn to read the error message from terminal

* The **first line** let you know **where**
* **Unexpected token** means you are missing something, usually a *parenthesis, bracket or curly brace*.
* **ReferenceError** is when you use an undefined variable, maybe TYPO?
* **TypeError: undefined is not a function** check your function/method name, maybe a typo? maybe it's not a correct use? ( string? array? object?)
